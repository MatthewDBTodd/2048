# 2048-AI
AI for the popular mobile game 2048 written for the Linux terminal (uses the ncurses library).

**Note**: I wrote this in the summer after my first year at university. So I was still very inexperienced, especially when it comes to best-practices such as unit testing, hence why there are no tests. I've long since moved on so won't be going back to add tests but I'll leave it here as it works well and I'm still proud of it as one of my first big(ish) C++ projects!

The AI currently seems to have a ceiling of around 80,000 points, where it will easily achieve the 4096 tile:

You can also play the game yourself, using the arrow keys:
